# Performance Optimization Implementation Plan

- [ ] 1. Establish performance baseline
  - Measure current bundle size using build tools
  - Document current page load times and performance metrics
  - Create git checkpoint before starting optimizations
  - _Requirements: 4.4_

- [ ] 2. Remove debug and development logging
  - [ ] 2.1 Remove Reports page debug logging
    - Remove debug useEffect from `src/pages/Reports.tsx` (lines 93-98)
    - Verify Reports page functionality remains intact
    - Test that metrics data is still processed correctly
    - _Requirements: 1.2, 4.1_

  - [ ] 2.2 Clean up main.tsx update check logging
    - Remove console.log statements from periodic update checks in `src/main.tsx`
    - Remove console.log from visibility change handler
    - Ensure update checking functionality still works
    - _Requirements: 1.3, 4.1_

  - [ ] 2.3 Optimize PWA utility logging
    - Wrap PWA console.log statements in development environment checks
    - Keep user-facing service worker messages that provide value
    - Maintain error logging for production debugging
    - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.4, 1.5_

- [ ] 3. Optimize bundle size and imports
  - [ ] 3.1 Review and validate import efficiency
    - Verify lucide-react imports are already tree-shaking friendly
    - Confirm React wildcard imports are appropriate for UI components
    - Document current import patterns are already optimized
    - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2_

  - [ ] 3.2 Optimize inline styles where beneficial
    - Review inline styles in components for optimization opportunities
    - Move static styles to CSS classes where appropriate
    - Keep dynamic styles inline (animations, calculated values)
    - _Requirements: 2.3_

- [ ] 4. Optimize performance-critical operations
  - [ ] 4.1 Optimize Reports page data transformations
    - Review array operations in Reports page enrichedMetrics calculation
    - Combine .map() and .filter() operations where possible
    - Ensure data processing remains efficient and readable
    - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2_

  - [ ] 4.2 Validate existing performance optimizations
    - Confirm useMemo and useCallback usage is appropriate
    - Verify Map usage for O(1) lookups in Routines page is optimal
    - Document that existing optimizations are already well implemented
    - _Requirements: 3.3, 3.4_

- [ ] 5. Build and validate optimizations
  - [ ] 5.1 Production build validation
    - Build application for production and verify no debug logging appears
    - Test all PWA functionality works correctly in production build
    - Confirm error logging still functions for production debugging
    - _Requirements: 1.1, 4.2_

  - [ ] 5.2 Performance measurement and comparison
    - Measure final bundle size and compare with baseline
    - Test page load times and interaction responsiveness
    - Document performance improvements achieved
    - _Requirements: 2.3, 3.4_

  - [ ] 5.3 Comprehensive functionality testing
    - Test user authentication and profile management
    - Test routine creation, editing, and execution workflows
    - Test task management and completion tracking
    - Test rewards system and time tracking
    - Test reports and analytics functionality
    - Verify all features work identically to before optimization
    - _Requirements: 4.1, 4.2, 4.3_
