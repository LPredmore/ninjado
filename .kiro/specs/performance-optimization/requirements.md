# Performance Optimization Requirements

## Introduction

This specification outlines performance optimization opportunities for the ninja-themed productivity app to improve efficiency, reduce bundle size, and enhance user experience without altering existing functionality.

## Glossary

- **React_Query_Cache**: The TanStack React Query caching mechanism for server state management
- **Component_Memoization**: React optimization technique using React.memo, useMemo, and useCallback
- **Bundle_Analyzer**: Tool to analyze JavaScript bundle size and identify optimization opportunities
- **Lazy_Loading**: Code splitting technique to load components only when needed
- **Local_Storage_Manager**: Centralized utility for managing localStorage operations
- **Performance_Metrics**: Browser performance measurement APIs for monitoring app performance

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to optimize React Query usage patterns, so that the app has better caching and fewer unnecessary network requests.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the app loads, THE React_Query_Cache SHALL use optimized stale time and cache time configurations
2. WHEN multiple components request the same data, THE React_Query_Cache SHALL serve cached data without duplicate network requests
3. WHEN query keys are used, THE React_Query_Cache SHALL use consistent and optimized key structures
4. WHERE query invalidation occurs, THE React_Query_Cache SHALL use selective invalidation patterns
5. WHILE the user navigates between pages, THE React_Query_Cache SHALL maintain relevant cached data

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to implement proper component memoization, so that unnecessary re-renders are prevented and performance is improved.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN props or state change, THE Component_Memoization SHALL prevent re-renders of components with unchanged dependencies
2. WHEN expensive calculations occur, THE Component_Memoization SHALL cache results using useMemo
3. WHEN callback functions are passed as props, THE Component_Memoization SHALL use useCallback to prevent child re-renders
4. WHERE complex objects are created in render, THE Component_Memoization SHALL optimize object creation patterns
5. WHILE components render, THE Component_Memoization SHALL minimize computational overhead

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to optimize localStorage usage patterns, so that storage operations are more efficient and centralized.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN localStorage operations occur, THE Local_Storage_Manager SHALL use a centralized utility for all storage operations
2. WHEN routine state is saved, THE Local_Storage_Manager SHALL batch multiple storage operations
3. WHEN storage keys are used, THE Local_Storage_Manager SHALL use consistent naming conventions
4. WHERE storage cleanup is needed, THE Local_Storage_Manager SHALL provide automated cleanup mechanisms
5. WHILE the app runs, THE Local_Storage_Manager SHALL minimize storage operation frequency

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to implement code splitting and lazy loading, so that the initial bundle size is reduced and loading performance is improved.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the app loads, THE Bundle_Analyzer SHALL identify components suitable for lazy loading
2. WHEN routes are accessed, THE Lazy_Loading SHALL load page components on demand
3. WHEN heavy components are used, THE Lazy_Loading SHALL defer loading until needed
4. WHERE dynamic imports are possible, THE Lazy_Loading SHALL use React.lazy for component splitting
5. WHILE the user navigates, THE Lazy_Loading SHALL provide smooth loading experiences

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to optimize efficiency calculation performance, so that complex calculations don't block the UI thread.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN efficiency calculations run, THE Performance_Metrics SHALL complete calculations without blocking UI updates
2. WHEN multiple task completions occur, THE Performance_Metrics SHALL batch calculation operations
3. WHEN historical data is processed, THE Performance_Metrics SHALL use optimized algorithms for large datasets
4. WHERE calculations are expensive, THE Performance_Metrics SHALL cache intermediate results
5. WHILE routines complete, THE Performance_Metrics SHALL provide real-time feedback without performance degradation

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to optimize timer and state management, so that routine tracking is more efficient and responsive.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN timers run, THE Performance_Metrics SHALL use efficient timer management without memory leaks
2. WHEN routine state changes, THE Performance_Metrics SHALL minimize localStorage write operations
3. WHEN visibility changes occur, THE Performance_Metrics SHALL handle background/foreground transitions efficiently
4. WHERE multiple timers exist, THE Performance_Metrics SHALL use consolidated timer management
5. WHILE routines are active, THE Performance_Metrics SHALL maintain accurate timing with minimal overhead
