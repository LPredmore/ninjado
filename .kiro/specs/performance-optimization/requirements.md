# Performance Optimization Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for improving the overall efficiency and performance of the NinjaDo application. The focus is on removing debug code, optimizing logging, reducing bundle size, and improving runtime performance while maintaining all existing functionality.

## Glossary

- **Debug Code**: Console logging and development-only code that should not run in production
- **Bundle Size**: The total size of JavaScript and CSS files served to users
- **Runtime Performance**: The speed and efficiency of the application during user interactions
- **Production Build**: The optimized version of the application deployed to users
- **Development Logging**: Console statements used for debugging during development

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Remove Debug and Development Logging

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to run efficiently without unnecessary debug logging so that performance is optimized in production.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN building for production, THE NinjaDo Application SHALL remove all debug console.log statements
2. WHEN building for production, THE NinjaDo Application SHALL remove development-only logging from Reports page
3. WHEN building for production, THE NinjaDo Application SHALL remove periodic update check logging from main.tsx
4. WHEN building for production, THE NinjaDo Application SHALL maintain error logging for production debugging
5. THE NinjaDo Application SHALL keep PWA service worker logging as it provides user value

### Requirement 2: Optimize Bundle Size and Imports

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to load faster so that I can start using it more quickly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN importing icons, THE NinjaDo Application SHALL use tree-shaking friendly imports from lucide-react
2. WHEN importing React utilities, THE NinjaDo Application SHALL avoid wildcard imports where possible
3. WHEN building the application, THE NinjaDo Application SHALL have a smaller bundle size than before optimization
4. WHEN loading the application, THE NinjaDo Application SHALL maintain all existing functionality

### Requirement 3: Optimize Performance-Critical Operations

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to respond quickly to my interactions so that the experience feels smooth.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN rendering large lists, THE NinjaDo Application SHALL use efficient data structures and algorithms
2. WHEN performing data transformations, THE NinjaDo Application SHALL minimize unnecessary operations
3. WHEN updating UI state, THE NinjaDo Application SHALL prevent unnecessary re-renders
4. WHEN processing user interactions, THE NinjaDo Application SHALL maintain responsive performance

### Requirement 4: Maintain Production Functionality

**User Story:** As a user, I want all application features to continue working after optimization so that no functionality is lost.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN optimizations are applied, THE NinjaDo Application SHALL preserve all user-facing functionality
2. WHEN optimizations are applied, THE NinjaDo Application SHALL maintain all existing workflows
3. WHEN optimizations are applied, THE NinjaDo Application SHALL continue to work with Lovable's interface
4. WHEN optimizations are applied, THE NinjaDo Application SHALL build successfully without errors
