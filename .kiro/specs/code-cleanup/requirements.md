# Code Cleanup Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for cleaning up redundant, unused, and orphaned code in the NinjaDo application. The goal is to reduce bundle size, improve maintainability, and remove unnecessary dependencies while ensuring the application continues to work with Lovable's interface.

## Glossary

- **NinjaDo Application**: The main React application for task and routine management
- **UI Components**: Reusable React components from the shadcn/ui library
- **Utility Functions**: Helper functions in the lib and utils directories
- **Bundle Size**: The total size of JavaScript and CSS files served to users
- **Lovable Interface**: The external interface that the application must maintain compatibility with

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Remove Unused UI Components

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to remove unused UI components so that the bundle size is reduced and the codebase is cleaner.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing UI component usage, THE NinjaDo Application SHALL identify components that are never imported or used
2. WHEN removing unused components, THE NinjaDo Application SHALL remove the corresponding component files from src/components/ui/
3. WHEN removing unused components, THE NinjaDo Application SHALL remove the corresponding dependencies from package.json
4. WHEN removing unused components, THE NinjaDo Application SHALL maintain all existing functionality
5. THE NinjaDo Application SHALL remove breadcrumb, chart, menubar, navigation-menu, context-menu, hover-card, pagination, table, drawer, command, aspect-ratio, and input-otp components

### Requirement 2: Maintain Lovable Compatibility

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to ensure that cleanup changes don't break Lovable's interface so that the application continues to work properly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN making cleanup changes, THE NinjaDo Application SHALL preserve all public API interfaces
2. WHEN making cleanup changes, THE NinjaDo Application SHALL maintain all existing component props and behaviors
3. WHEN making cleanup changes, THE NinjaDo Application SHALL ensure all pages and routes continue to function
4. WHEN making cleanup changes, THE NinjaDo Application SHALL preserve all user-facing functionality

### Requirement 3: Validate Cleanup Results

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to validate that cleanup changes work correctly so that no functionality is broken.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN cleanup is complete, THE NinjaDo Application SHALL build successfully without errors
2. WHEN cleanup is complete, THE NinjaDo Application SHALL have a smaller bundle size than before
3. WHEN cleanup is complete, THE NinjaDo Application SHALL pass all existing functionality tests
4. WHEN cleanup is complete, THE NinjaDo Application SHALL maintain all user workflows
